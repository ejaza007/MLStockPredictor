# Support Vector Regression for Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a Python script that uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices based on historical data. The script reads data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, fits two SVR models (linear and RBF kernels), and visualizes the predictions.

## Overview

This script demonstrates the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for stock price prediction. It uses historical stock price data to train SVR models with both linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels. The models are then used to predict future stock prices.

### Features

- Reads historical stock price data from a CSV file
- Preprocesses and normalizes the data
- Trains linear and RBF SVR models
- Visualizes the original data and model predictions
- Predicts future stock prices based on trained models
